# Tp Architecture
Developing a web application for the EVAX platform (<i>Coronavirus Vaccinaction</i>).<br/>
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.
## Architecture choice
Angular follows a component oriented architecture, it implements a lot of the concepts of MVVM (<i>Model View ViewModel</i>).<br/>
This architecture offers several advantages :
 <ul>
 <li>Two-Way Data Binding : is the time-saving feature that automates some processes in our application</li>
 <Li>Readable and Testable Code :  makes application's code logical, consistent, and easy to follow</Li>
 <Li>Efficient Problem-Solving Patterns : offers powerful DI (<i>Dependency Injection</i>) instrument and services to resolve various productivity issues and speed up the development process</Li>
 </ul>
 
## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
